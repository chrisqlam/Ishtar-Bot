# Ishtar-Bot
A discord bot using node.js, DiscordJS and GraphQL.
This is a little side project I do for fun. I intend to use a Database to keep track of the reminders, implement a points system and eventually to query the Anilist database other things.

#Commands
##!help - DM's you a list of commands
##!help [command] - Details the command
##!roll - Queries the Anilist database for a random character and returns an image and information
!userinfo [@user] - Shows you information about the user such as profile picture and username
!remind - A remind function
!ping - Pings the bot to see if it's online
!drank - Good job staying hydrated!!
